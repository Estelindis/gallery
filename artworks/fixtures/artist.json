I prefer drawing people and animals (fantasy or real), but I enjoy creating fantasy or sci-fi cities and landscapes too. My art is in private collections and magazines. I have won several art contests. My illustrations can be found in e-books, books, and comics. My greatest success is that my art is in the documentary for the extended edition of The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies.”",
